// These students wrote this program:

// NetID,LastName,FirstName

// 

// 


// postfix.cxx evaluates a postfix expression consisting of digits and

// the operators + and *.

// 

// Here is the algorithm:

// - While there is more input,

//    - read a character from input

//    - if a digit, push its value onto a stack of integer operands

//    - if an operator, pop the stack twice, perform the operation,

//      and push the result on the stack

// - Pop the stack to get the result

//

// Notes:

// - To get from a character like '3' to the integer 3, subtract the

//   character '0'. For example, 

//     char c = '3';     // c's value is the character '3'

//     int  i = c - '0'; // i's value is the integer 3

//   (This works because '3' is encoded as 51 and '0' is encoded as 48.)

// - You will need a stack of integer operands. Convert my stack to

//   use integers, not characters.

// - You should revise my makefile to produce an executable "p".

// - One fun way to run p is to run "i | p", using the Linux pipe

//   operator, "|". The "i | p" command says "use the output of i as

//   the input of p." You can then provide infix input to "i | p". The

//   infix program will convert it to postfix, and the postfix program

//   will evaluate the postfix.

//

// Hint: Start by copying the code from TemplateStack/infix.cxx.

// Compile. Then transform that working code.

// 

// Here are two extra challenges:

// - Also implement the operators - and /.

// - Process not only one-digit numbers, but also numbers of several

//   digits, like 152. (Still read numbers one character at a time.)
